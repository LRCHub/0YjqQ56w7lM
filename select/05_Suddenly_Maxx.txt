Uuuh yeeah oh oh oh
Suddenly

The waiting... were broken day by day
Like the windows of the old school and the playground's gone away
The owners searchers despers... to find
It's been deserted by the... and the... got to say

Sensation's a new joke, dead bodys on TV
Time is flying by, have you got the time for me
The daily papers dirty that keeps the cold man warm
The spice cracked wide open and the... store

Suddenly
It did happen suddenly
Woh oh oh
Woh oh

Oh no I can take no more

Called up in cross by... a little call expense
A child crying, eyes appear behinds a golden fence
He's searching for the freedom he'd may never see
But the mother of two children needs and eagle to be free

What's around the corner, why can't we see not far
Like a four teenage boys... with... stolen... car
If the person's skin is coloured he knows the words he used
Time is going by so fast, ignorance is no excuse

Oh no I can take no more

Ooh oh no... it happened suddenly...
